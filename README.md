# street-foody

Street-foody is a responsive website that introduces travelers to a substantial part of Asian culture - street food, and allows street vendors to have a dedicated online space. For our first version, we'll focus on Saigon (or Ho Chi Minh City)'s street food.

## Project Vision and Goals

### Problems to solve

People have trouble finding street vendors based on name and food type if they’ve never been to Vietnam. We also want to build a place for local people and even foreigners to know about the prices and ratings before they arrive at the vendors to help them make better choices. 

### Goals

1. Allows users search  a place to eat based on street vendor’s name and food type
2. Allows users sort and filter through street food based on price tags and ratings
3. Allows street vendors access to online advertising by submitting forms through a url to a google form (in the future there will be a “real” server based form to fill out)
